          </p>
          <ul class="ml-30 last-child">
              <li><b>Location Information:</b> When you use the Services, we collect precise location data. If you permit the WeOne app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. </li>
              <li><b>Contacts Information:</b> If you permit the WeOne app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection. </li>
              <li><b>Transaction Information:</b> We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.
              </li>
              <li><b>Usage and Preference Information: </b>We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Statement.
              </li>
              <li><b>Device Information:</b> We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information. </li>
              <li><b>Call and SMS Data : </b>Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Drivers. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message. </li>
              <li><b>Log Information:</b> When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.

              </li>
              <li><b>Cookies : </b>We and our affiliates, third parties, and other partners use cookies and other identification technologies on our websites, mobile applications, electronic communications, advertisements, and other online services (collectively, the "Services") for a number of purposes, including: authenticating users, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends, and generally understanding the online behaviors and interests of people who interact with our Services. You can read more here about the types of cookies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.
              </li>
              <li><b>Cookies Overview:</b> Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” So cookies served by WeOne while you are on <a href="www.weoneapp.com">www.weoneapp.com</a> are first party cookies. Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you’re visiting are called “third party cookies.” So, we may allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit <a href="www.weoneapp.com">www.weoneapp.com</a>, and that would be a third party cookie. Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session Cookies” only last only as long as your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. For example, they may recognize your device when you re-open your browser and browse the internet again.

              </li>
              <li><b>Other Identification Technologies :</b> We call this a Cookie Statement, but the statement addresses cookies and other identification technologies we may use or permit on our Services. “Pixel tags” (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including for example: device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, and other similar information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. “Local storage” refers generally to other places on a browser or device where information can be stored by websites, ads, or third parties (such as HTML5 local storage and browser cache). “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, and thereby allow the partner to collect certain information about user interaction with the app and information about the user device and network information. </li>
              <li><b>Your Choices : </b>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, they are an important part of how our Services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the "Help" or “Preferences” menu. Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link, and we have indicated where this is possible in the table above.
              </li>
              <li>Removing or rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies which may be used by us or our partners in connection with our Services. To delete or disable flash cookies please visit this site for more information.

          <h3>23. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PLATFORM PERMISSIONS</h3>
          <p class="last-child">Most mobile platforms (ions, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the WeOne app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the WeOne app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new iOS Permissions page and Android Permissions page. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we’ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>
          <h3>24.     INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES</h3>

          <h3>30. VULNERABILITY RECOGNITION : </h3>
          <p><b>At WeOne we are looking for any vulnerability which could negatively affect the security of our users. The main categories of vulnerabilities that we look for are the following:
</b></p>
          <ul class="last-child">
              <li>Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</li>
              <li>Cross-site Request Forgery

              <li>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</li>
              <li>SQL or no SQL Injection</li>
              <li>Server-side Remote Code Execution (RCE)
              </li>
              <li>XML External Entity Attacks (XXE)</li>

              </li>
              <li>Access Control Issues (Insecure Direct Object Reference issues, etc)
              </li>
              <li>Exposed Administrative Panels that don't require login credentials</li>
              <li>Directory Traversal Issues
              </li>
              <li>Local File Disclosure (LFD)
              </li>
              <li>Information Disclosure of Sensitive Information (such as system configurations, user data, etc)</li>
              <li>Publicly accessible login panels
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="last-child">Please note that if vulnerability (such as XSS) only affects a small population, e.g. a browser with a low usage percentage, the reward will be determined accordingly. Vulnerabilities that exist only in antiquated browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 for example, are not in scope.</p>
          <h3>What type of vulnerabilities is WeOne NOT looking for?</h3>
          <p>The following are vulnerabilities which WeOne does not consider severe enough for a reward:</p>
          <ul class="last-child">
              <li>Best practices concerns.</li>
              <li>Highly speculative reports about theoretical damage. Be concrete. </li>
              <li>Self-XSS that cannot be used to exploit other users (this includes having a user paste JavaScript into the browser console)
              </li>
              <li>Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they're an issue
              </li>
              <li>Denial of Service Attacks</li>
              <li>Reflected File Download (RFD)</li>
              <li>window.opener Related Issues</li>
              <li>Physical or social engineering attempts (this includes phishing attacks against WeOne employees)</li>
              <li>Content injection issues</li>
              <li>Non-validated reports from automated web vulnerability scanners (Acunetix, Vega, etc)</li>
              <li>Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) with minimal security implications (Logout CSRF, etc.)</li>
              <li>Missing autocomplete attributes
              </li>
              <li>Missing cookie flags on non-security sensitive cookies</li>
              <li>Issues which require physical access to a victim’s computer</li>
              <li>Missing security headers which do not present an immediate security vulnerability</li>
              <li>Fraud issues (please see the below section elaborating on this)</li>
              <li>SSL/TLS scan reports (this means output from sites such as SSL Labs)</li>
              <li>Banner grabbing issues (figuring out what web server we use, etc)</li>
              <li>Open ports without an accompanying proof-of-concept demonstrating vulnerability
              </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Policy on chaining bugs and privilege escalation?</h3>
          <p class="last-child">If you have managed to compromise a WeOne-owned server we do not allow for escalations such as port scanning internal networks, privilege escalation attempts, attempting to pivot to other systems, etc. If you get access to a WeOne server please report it us and we will reward you with an appropriate bounty taking into full consideration the severity of what could be done. Chaining a CSRF vulnerability with a self XSS may not be object under our sole discretion . Using AWS access key to dump user info is not considered appropriate.</p>
          <h3>Do you provide test accounts?</h3>
          <p class="last-child">As of this time we do not have a good system for creating test accounts for our bug bounty submitters. Please create an account as you would normally and perform testing with that account or accounts. Whenever possible only test against yourself, never other users. If there is every a situation where you cannot test a bug while adhering to this please let us know and we will help figure out an appropriate solution. </p>

          <h3>Public disclosure:</h3>
          <p class="last-child">Having found a particularly interesting or clever bug in a WeOne service , we’re happy to publicly disclose your bug once it has been remediated by our developers. Please note that in certain situations we may request more time to investigate an issue internally to ensure that it is properly fixed across all WeOne services. Public disclosure before WeOne has had time to remediate an issue is grounds for immediate forfeiture of any reward as well as possible removal from the bug bounty program.</p>
          <h3>Microsites (for example, city-specific WeOne sites and blogs) in scope?</h3>
          <p class="last-child">Microsites are an important part of how WeOne reaches people in diverse local markets all around the world. Since they have smaller audiences, shouldn't contain much or any user data and aren’t part of the WeOne.com domain space, the impact of issues on these sites is significantly less severe. Since we are primary interested in vulnerabilities which could lead to the exfiltration of customer information, vulnerabilities in microsite services will not be rewarded for except in extraordinary circumstances.
          </p>
          <h3>Fraud related issues.</h3>
          <p class="last-child">If you’d like to report an issue with our fraud, please contact <a href="mailto:help@weoneapp.com">help@weoneapp.com </a>These type of issues are important but we unfortunately cannot reward issues if this type at this time. Specifically promo code fraud and give-get fraud is abuse of our promotional offers and referral codes in order to get free rides from WeOne are a common submission. We do not consider these in scope for our bug bounty program at this time unless they show an explicit technical vulnerability in our software. Lack of verification for things such as phone numbers, credit cards, etc are all fraud related issues and are not in scope for this bug bounty program.</p>
          <h3>Bounty Payout Range</h3>
          <ul class="last-child">
              <li><b>Critical issues (INR 20,000) </b>- Remote code execution on a production server. Exposure of information that identifies individuals (social security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, driver license images) Full account takeover of rider/partner account without interaction. Payment or partner invoice information exposure at scale. Potential access to source code. XSS in Toolshed (our internal account management system), or server-side request forgery (SSRF). Vulnerabilities leading to the compromise of an employee account (with a way to bypass two-factor).
              </li>
              <li><b>Significant Issues (INR 10,000) </b>- Stored Cross-site Scripting which can cause significant brand damage (e.g. in a homepage), missing authorization checks leading to the exposure of email addresses, date of birth, names, phone numbers, etc.</li>
              <li><b>Medium Issues (INR 5,000) </b>- Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS), most Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) issues, access control issues which do not exposed PII but affect other accounts, rate limiting issues, account validation bypasses (being able to change driver picture, etc). Any vulnerability which allows the bulk lookup of user UUIDs (e.g. turn an auto-incrementing ID into a UUID, turn an email into a UUID).
              </li>
              <li><b>Fraud Issues</b> - Send these to <a href="mailto:help@weoneapp.com">help@weoneapp.com</a> We currently do not reward for fraud issues.
